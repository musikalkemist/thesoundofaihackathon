## Communication channels
Our main communication platform will be The Sound of AI Slack. [You can sign up to The Sound of AI Slack community here](https://valeriovelardo.com/the-sound-of-ai-community/). We'll be using two channels on Slack: 

- _#hack-organisation_ - Channel used for the organisers to provide general info to participants  
- _#hack-participants_ - Channel used by participants to communicate among themselves (e.g., propose ideas, build teams)
- _#hack-questions_ - Channel used by participants to ask questions to organisers before and during the event
- Slack direct messages can be used to start conversations among participants / team members

Participants are encouraged to use the video-conferencing tools they prefer to organise among themselves.

Community sessions (e.g., open / awards ceremonies) will be held on Google Meet. Organisers will provide Google Meet links during the event on Slack in the _#hack-organisation_ channel.

## FAQs

#### Should I have a team to participate?
You're free to come with an already-formed team. However, it is possible to participate without a team. 

We set out a process to help you find a team before the start of the hackathon. The step-by-step process is outlined in the [Eventbrite Online Event Page](https://www.eventbrite.com/x/365806857157/) - you can access this page only if you've registered for the hackathon. We'll also have a Team Building session at the beginning of the event for those who couldn't join a team before the start of the event. However, we highly encourage you to join a team before the hackathon starts by using the "offline" team building process we implemented.

#### Who should participate?
Hackers, programmers, technologitsts, AI audio / music engineers, researchers, product managers are obviously the main culprits. However, people with non-technical skills are also invited to participate. Well-rounded hacker teams with members from different backgrounds are the ones who usually deliver best during hackathons. 

#### Is there a participation fee?
No, the hackathon is FREE.

#### Who owns the Intellectual Property (IP) of the hacks?
The IP of the hacks remains with the teams who created the code / products.
